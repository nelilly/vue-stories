> Vue Stories

On December 12, 2008, I launched the first Twitter fiction magazine called [Thaumatrope](https://thaumatrope.greententacles.com/about/). **vue-stories** is an exploration of Thaumatrope with the modern front-end technology as a single page application in Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
